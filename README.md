## ‚ùì Business Questions Addressed

This project answers the following real-world business questions:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   Summary statistics of available fields in both datasets.

2. **Marketing Strategy for Long-Distance Bikes**  
   Identify user segments more likely to benefit from bikes designed for longer trips.

3. **Predictive Maintenance**  
   Develop methods to proactively detect and flag faulty or worn-out bikes before user complaints.

4. **Company Growth & Demand Spread**  
   - Analyze whether the growth in trips is evenly distributed across the city.  
   - Identify contributing factors to demand spikes.

5. **User Segmentation for Pricing Strategy**  
   Classify users into "Loyal" vs. "Occasional" and study behavioral differences.

6. **Churn Detection**  
   Identify users whose ride frequency has declined and suggest personalized incentive packages.

7. **Revenue Optimization Simulation**
   - (a) Simulate increased revenue from better bike redistribution and calculate related costs.
   - (b) Evaluate the ROI of expanding the bike fleet or station count, using location-based analysis and sensitivity tests.
